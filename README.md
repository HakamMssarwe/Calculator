# Calculator

I tried to create something similiar to the windows default calculator, here is the result!


## What I learned

1. Windows Form.
2. How to solve problems in a better way and turn bigger problems into small ones.


PS: I made this last year and I forgot to implement the usage of float numbers, might add the feature later on (depending on my schedule and time)
