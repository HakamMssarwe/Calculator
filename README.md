# Calculator

I tried to create something similiar to the windows default calculator, here is the result!


## What does the Calculator include?
1.Complex equasions such as parentheses equastions, percentage and etc..
2.Features such as checking incorrect equasion formats and other features like delete, reset and etc..

## What I learned
1. Windows Form.
2. How to solve problems in a better way and turn bigger problems into small ones.

## Note
I made this on my first year of college and I forgot to add the feature to allow float numbers. For now the calculator can only support calculations with integers but can also return float numbers as a result
